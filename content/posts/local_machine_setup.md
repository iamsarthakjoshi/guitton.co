I still haven't had the time to setup a proper [dotfiles](https://www.quora.com/What-are-dotfiles) setup.

But I use a script that gets me 80% of the way there and that I'm pretty happy with.

Credits go to Gitlab's Data team: their open source [onboarding script](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/analytics/blob/master/admin/onboarding_script.sh) heavily influenced my script in its present form.
