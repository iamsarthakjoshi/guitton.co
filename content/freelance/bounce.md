Helped my friends at https://bouncebot.io/ set up their growth KPIs and analyse their user data.
The dashboard had the following features :

- Top 5 events / Most used mental exercise
- Segmentation of users using Recency, Frequency, Engagement
- Daily / Monthly new users
- N-day retention curve
- Usage interval (time between repetition of the critical event within 60 days)
- User lyfecycle (new / current / dormant / resurrected users)
- Active days in month (smile curve)
